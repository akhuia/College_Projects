# College Projects


Here's a list of the projects I have been worked on during my college curriculum (mostly at UW Seattle), along with a folder containing my CV.
The primary intent of this repo is for making my projects publicly available to recruiters, students, and any other person. 

Most of these have been group projects, done in teams of atmost 5 people - almost all of them students at UW.

The projects belong to different categories (with some overlap).

Here's the file organization, based on project categories and content:

1. Projects
  1. Business and Consulting
  2. Health-based projects
  3. UX and Visualization
  4. Data Science
2. CV
3. License
4. List of Authors

Feel free to drop me a line if you want to chat about this.
