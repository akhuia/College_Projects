<h1>Introduction</h1>

Our group was tasked with designing the use and user experience for a repurposed cigarette vending machine. We decided to focus solving issues related with cities that come under "party culture".

<h1>Ideation</h1>

<p>“Party Culture” is universal and can be found throughout the world.
Party Culture  can be broadly defined as a culture with disposable income for leisure, young, dance-centric, loose, inebriated, and enjoy the nightlife. A need we have discovered in these Party Cultures is what happens when the party is over. Women wearing high-heels need relief that doesn’t leave them barefoot on nasty and dirty streets. We propose to repurpose cigarette vending machines to dispense needed after-party relief. Items would include: comfortable slippers for women, water, Ibuprofen, condoms, and etc.</p>

<p>Partygoers aren’t the only focus of this venture. We will be utilizing the ‘Philanthropic Capitalism’ business model, inspired by TOMS, to extend the reach of these relief vending machines to assist those in need. These relief machines will provide footwear, blankets, and etc. to communities in need. Essentially, the Party Culture will be providing the funds to support this philanthropic venture.
</p>
<p>Since this was part of an International UX and Communication class, we decided to focus on Las Vegas.</p>

Here's a quick [slide deck](http://aklogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AfterParty.pdf) storyboarding the concept, value and use case.


<h1>Sketching, Evaluation, Brainstorming and Rapid Iterations</h1>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

 
1. Payton comes out of the club and sees the vending machine.
2.  Screen 1:
2a. Video of a lady wearing heels with aching legs, goes to the vending machine, selects the shoes, buys them, gets them out of the machine, and then wears them with an expression of contentment/ relief.
2b. There's a button (Proceed) on the screen which takes the payton to Screen 2.
 
3. Screen 2: 

    The goodies are displayed on the screen, with their respective costs.
     The Next button takes the payton to Screen 3.
                            -  If the Comfies/ slippers are selected, then it goes to Screen 3a.
                            -  Else, the payton is taken directly to Screen 3.
    Else, if payton doesn't do anything for 30 seconds, the transaction times out and Screen 1 is displayed again.
 
4. Screen 3a:

     The payton selects the size of the comfies, which can be adjusted by +/- buttons.
      Upon pressing Next, the payton is taken to Screen 3.
      The Back button takes the payton back to Screen 2.
      Else, if payton doesn't do anything for 30 seconds, the transaction times out and Screen 1 is displayed again.
 
5. Screen 3:

      All the items selected are shown here with their costs, and with the total cost.
      The slippers are shown along with their size.
      The Back button takes the payton back to Screen 3a  if the slippers were selected. Else, it goes back to Screen 2.
      The Buy button takes the payton to Screen 4 for payment.
       Else, if payton doesn't do anything for 30 seconds, the transaction times out and Screen 1 is displayed again.
 
6. Screen 4

     Message to enter the credit/debit card in the slot is displayed, along with a picture of the same.
     The Back button takes the payton back to Screen 3a.
     When the payton inserts the card, if successful, the payment is processed and it goes to Screen 4a. The receipt and the goodies are dispersed at this point.
     Else, in case of an error, an error message to retry is shown (Screen 4b).
     Else, if payton doesn't do anything for 30 seconds, the transaction times out and Screen 1 is displayed again.
 
7. Screen 4a

     The confirmation message is shown along with a message to collect stuff from the below (remains for 10 seconds, and then Screen 1 is shown. (The transaction ends with the confirmation message).
 
8. Screen 4b
 
     The error message remains till successful payment or 45 seconds (whichever happens first), after which Screen 4 is shown again.
